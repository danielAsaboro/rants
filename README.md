This is not a code repository.
Instead, it's a place I come and commit to when I don't have the will to code for personal unseen reasons.

7th of July, 2023.

I don't think I will recover from this asap.
Nothing I can do, but something I would have to live with.
And it's about Treblle's last Hackathon.

That's what not writing a good readme can do.
It hurts but lesson for another time.
